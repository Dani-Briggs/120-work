# HW-10

## Summary

I enjoyed this assigment. It was a bit hard to figure out what to turn into an array and what to turn into a function. I knew for a fact I wanted to redo my hw-5 assigment, because It would be the easy for to do.

## Steps
I started with my hw-5 and looked at the parts that could be made in functions and arrays. I tested out multple things, like trying to get my array to store colors and sizes. I ended up have it store the width, height and angle numbers, that I could call in my code. The two fuctions I made were for the body and the eyes.


## Disscusion

I wouldn't mind talking about how to have arrays store colors since I struggle with that.

## Problems

I struggle with what to do with my array. I wanted to store my colors and then call them in my functions, but that proved to be diffcult.

## Helping Others

Didn't get a chance to help.
