# HW-3 Response

I thought this assignment was kinda fun. It reminded me of when I was learning python in high school. It especially reminded me of the turtle function in python, which I really enjoyed. The videos for this week were very easy to follow and help me go step-by-step through this assignment. I had some simple problems that I was able to figure out. An example was that, the hw-3 wasn't showing up through the GitHub link and I fix it by deleting an empty folder that was in the hw-3 folder. I can't wait to start creating designs with p5.
