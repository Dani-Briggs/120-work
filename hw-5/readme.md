## Summary

This assignment was a little tricky for my. I did have an issue with the assignment that did take away somme of my work time. Once I got it figured out, I started to have a little more fun with it. I wanted to do more, but I was already running out of time so, this is the end product.


## Steps

First, I made sure I had all the basics for this sketch. I made sure I did the setup and draw function right. After that, I started on my little ball character. Ran into an issue so, I posted it on the issue page on Github. I figured out the probleme thanks to the people that helped me on the forum.

## Disscusion

I wouldn't mind talking about the math more, since math isn't my strength.

## Problems

When I opened my index in my browser, nothing would pop up. Someone on the forum said to put the code in a different file and delete the old one and that worked.

## Helping Others

Didn't get a chance to help.
