# HW-4

## Summary

I thought this assignment was fun and challenging. I mention in the last response that I used python before and this assignment brought my back to when I used it back then and I can't wait to drive even further into p5.

## Steps

The first step I took was to get my canvas setup, usuing the example provided by the website. Once I got the basics done, I started by putting the color I wanted for the canvas. I started with the body of the Monster, making it a basic rounded rectangle. Then I made the head which had two rounded courners and two pointed ones. After that, It was the legs and arms, which were the same rounded rectangle. I then did the details. I started with the eyes, that were both simple ellipses. The mouth was a simple line with two triangle teeth. I gave the Monster a yellow belly and then gave two pink circle hands and feet.

## Disscusion

I would mind Disscusing the rotate function, since I found it a bit hard to work with in this assignment.

## Problems

Some problems I had were getting the triangles for the teeth to be where I wanted them to be. I wanted to put a triangle on the monster's body but I struggle to get it where I wanted and I was running out of time so, I ended up doing the yellow belly. I also struggle with the rotate function, not because the shape wouldn't rotate, but because it made it difficult to move the shape to where I wanted to be.

## Helping Others

I didn't get the chance to help anyone on this assignment.
