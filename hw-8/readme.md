# HW-8

## Summary

I enjoyed this assigment. I did something simliar in my highschool class in
python, but this one was a bit more diffcult. This one was diffcult to get started, but eventully
I got some inspriration from the examples on the website and tried to make some diagonal, blinking squares.

## Steps

Once I setup my canvas, I started playing with the examples on the website to see what I could do. Once I started playing with that code, I played around with it more in atom, and eventully got the code the way I wanted it to be.


## Disscusion

I would like to talk more about triangles. I might have brought them up before, but I wanted to try and use them for this assigment, but it diffcult for me to set up certain varables to work with the size and position of the shape.

## Problems

I didn't have any code breaking problems for this assigment

## Helping Others

Didn't get a chance to help.
