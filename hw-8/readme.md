# HW-8

## Summary

I had a lot of fun with this assignment. I was worried about the math but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I struggle with coming up with an idea, but once I got started I didn't have any trouble. I'm really happy with how this turned out.

## Steps

I started by playing around with the random function; by making a circle's stroke turn into different colors and playing with the size of the circle as well. From there, I stared plaing with the movement, having the circle follow the mouse and then I added constrain walls. The last thing I did was add the map function to change the size of the circle as the cursor moved from left to right.

## Disscusion

I would like a little more disscusion on the map function, since that's what I struggled with in this assignment.


## Problems

I had trouble figure out how and where to put the map function into this sketch. I looked at a couple of examples on the website and p5 reference page and I was able to figure out hoe to fit it in to my sketch.

## Helping Others

Didn't get a chance to help.
