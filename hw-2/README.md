# Weekly Response
## 1. Summary
- On this assignment, I learned how to use the GitHub desktop and the text editor Atom. I learned how to make a markdown file and got an idea of how the assignments in this class are going to work.

## 2. The Steps Towards Completion
- The first step I took was to follow the [creative coding website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/overview/) to see what we are learning this week and what the homework would be. I already had the GitHub desktop and Atom installed since last week so, I didn't need to worry about that. After that I followed the examples from the website to get used to the programs. Finally, I got started on the homework. I also practice using code, like `git status`!

## 3. Problems
- I haven't had any problems with this assignment.

## 4. Further Discussion
- There isn't really anything I want any further discussion on at this point in time.

## 5. Helping Classmates
- Sadly, I didn't get a chance to answer any questions this week, but hopefully I'll get the chance to help someone.
