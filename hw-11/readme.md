[My sketch](https://dani-briggs.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)

# HW-11

## Summary

  This assignment was hard at first. I didn't know what I wanted to do at first, then I got the idea of basically combining the two examples from the website to create a bunch of buzzing bees. Then I ran into some problems when the sketch wouldn't show up and then trying to get the bees to buzz.

## Steps

 I tested out multple things on the examples on the website first before I started my sketch. I wanted to see what made things worked for each sketch and try to figure out how to put them together. I did run into some trouble when the sketch wouldn't show up and posted my issue on github. That issue got resolved and then I had to deal with it not moving. Through some problem solving I figured that out as well.


## Disscusion

  I want to talk about lines, because I wanted to add anntenas on my bees but trying to put a line to go with the moving body was hard. I wanted to add strips on the body too, but I ran out of time.

## Problems

  I struggle with my sketch not showing up and trying to get my bees to buzz.

## Helping Others

  Didn't get a chance to help, personally, but their were some other people struggling with the same thing and were able to figure out what was wrong through the solution I got.
